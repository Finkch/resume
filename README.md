# README

This is Skyler Alderson's resume. Whenever a change is pushed to main, a GitHub Actions is dispatched to automatically stitch `resume.md` into `resume.pdf`. To see how that works, take a look at `.github/workflows/toPDF.yml`.

`resume.md` is the markdown version of Skyler's resume and is the component that is manually updated. `resume.pdf` is an automatic reflection of `resume.md`.
